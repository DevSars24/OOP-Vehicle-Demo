# 🚗 Vehicle OOP Demo  

> **A simple yet powerful demonstration of Advanced Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++ using a Vehicle Management System example.**

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To **master the 4 pillars of OOP** —  
1️⃣ **Encapsulation** 🔒  
2️⃣ **Inheritance** 🧬  
3️⃣ **Polymorphism** 🎭  
4️⃣ **Abstraction** 🎯  

— by implementing them in a **real-world inspired mini-project** with minimal complexity but maximum clarity.  

---

## 🛠 Features  
- **🔒 Encapsulation:** Private/protected data members with getters & setters  
- **🧬 Inheritance:** Base class `Vehicle` and derived classes `Car` & `Bike`  
- **🎭 Polymorphism:** Virtual functions for runtime method overriding  
- **🎯 Abstraction:** Pure virtual methods to force derived class implementation  
- **♻️ Clean Code:** Easy to read, beginner-friendly, and reusable
